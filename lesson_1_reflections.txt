How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It save a lot of time consumed on searching for a bug manually.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It helps me learn from my previous mistakes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
It helps me make meaningful commits, like one commit per logical change, and it prevents adding small not useful commits.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
May be it's simpler to save a snapshot of the project, Google Docs might be looking for optimizing the history in term of storage but
it will need more processing!

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
They could be used to view and compare between different commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Because I'll always be able to go back to a working version whenever I mess up with in my code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I want to use git in my projects!
